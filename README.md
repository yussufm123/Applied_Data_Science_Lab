These are series of assignment projects from [WoldQuant University](https://www.wqu.edu/) which are offered through the Applied Data Science Lab program and were assigned to me at the end of each module.

**Project 1 & 2: Housing prices prediction â€“ Brazil & Mexico City**

These projects involve predicting housing prices using a regression model. It includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, Linear and Ridge regression model training, correlation studies, price prediction, and evaluation.

Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, category_encoders, Linear and Ridge regression.

**Project 3: Air quality in Dar es salaam**

This project analyzes air quality in Dar es Salaam using time series techniques. It involves querying and extracting data from MongoDB, data preprocessing, EDA,  autoregression (AR) models , forecasting, and evaluation of pollutants like PM2.5.

Tools: MongoDB, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels.

**Project 4: Earthquake damage in Nepal**

This project involves building classification models for predicting whether a building will be damage during an earthquake. The key steps include querying SQL database, data preprocessing, EDA, builiding Logistic regression and Decision tree models, evaluating and communicating results.

Tools: SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, category_encoders, Logistic regression, Decision tree.

**Project 5: Bankruptcy in Taiwan**

In this project, real-world financial data from Taiwan companies was used to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy. It involves decompressing and loading data from JSON files, balancing data with a random over sampler,  builiding Random forest classifer, GridSearchCV, confusion matrix, evaluating, model deployment, and communicating results.

Tools: JSON, Pandas, scikit-learn, RandomOverSampler, Random forest classifer, GridSearchCV.

**Project 6: Small Business Owners in the United States**

This project involves examining some demographic characteristics of the group, such as age, income category, and debt vs home value. Then selecting high-variance features to create a KMneans clustering model to divide small business owners into subgroups, and lastly creating PCA scatter plot to highlight the differences between these subgroups. Additionally, it also includes developing an interactive dash web that combine all of these elements into a dynamic web application that will allow users to choose their own features, build a model, and evaluate its performance through a graphical user interface.

Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, scikit-learn, StandardScaler, KMeans, Dash, HTML.
