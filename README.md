The projects are from [WoldQuant University] (https://www.wqu.edu/) which are offered the Applied Data Science program.

**Project 1 & 2: Housing prices prediction â€“ Brazil & Mexico City**

These projects involve predicting housing prices using a linear regression model. It includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, model training, correlation studies, price prediction, and evaluation.

Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, category_encoders.

**Project 3: Air quality in Dar es salaam**

This project analyzes air quality in Dar es Salaam using time series techniques. It involves querying and extracting data from MongoDB, data preprocessing, EDA,  autoregression (AR) models , forecasting, and evaluation of pollutants like PM2.5.

Tools: MongoDB, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels.

**Project 4: Earthquake damage in Nepal**

This project involves building classification models for predicting whether a building will be damage during an earthquake. The key steps include querying SQL database, data preprocessing, EDA, builiding Logistic regression and Decision tree models, evaluating and communicating results.

Tools: SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, category_encoders.

**Project 5: Bankruptcy in Taiwan**

In this project, real-world financial data from Taiwan companies was used to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy. It involves decompressing and loading data from JSON files, balancing data with a random over sampler,  builiding Random forest classifer, GridSearchCV, confusion matrix, evaluating, model deployment, and communicating results.

Tools: JSON, Pandas, scikit-learn, imblearn.
